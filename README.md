# ChatGpt-Clone
This repository contains a ChatGpt clone web application implemented with Node.js as the backend and Tailwind CSS for the frontend. The clone allows users to ask questions and receive responses generated by the OpenAI GPT-3 model. The application stores relevant chat data in MongoDB, enabling faster retrieval of previously asked questions from the database.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for asking questions and receiving responses.
- Integration with the OpenAI GPT-3 model for generating answers.
- Data persistence using MongoDB to store chat history.
- Efficient retrieval of previously asked questions from the database.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
- MongoDB: Install and configure MongoDB on your system.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dhanmeetsingh/ChatGpt-Clone.git
## Usage
Enter your question in the input field and click the "Ask" button.
The application will check if the question exists in the MongoDB database.
If the question is found, the corresponding answer will be retrieved from the database and displayed.
If the question is not found, the application will use the OpenAI GPT-3 model to generate an answer and store it in the database for future use.
